{"id":"illm-k8s-ai-lab-x1z","title":"ArgoCD app stuck in terminating state after cluster deletion","description":"When tearing down experiments, we delete the ArgoCD app with --wait=false then immediately delete the Kind cluster. But the app has a resources-finalizer that requires ArgoCD to clean up resources on the target cluster. Since the cluster is already deleted, the finalizer can never complete and the app is stuck forever in Terminating state.\n\nObserved: deletionTimestamp set but app not deleted due to finalizer.\n\nImpact: Subsequent deploys see 'resource is currently being deleted' warning and may not work correctly.\n\nFix options:\n1. Wait for app deletion before cluster deletion (slow)\n2. Remove finalizer before deleting app when cluster is being destroyed\n3.
