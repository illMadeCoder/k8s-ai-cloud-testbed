  "analysis": {
    "summary": "This logging comparison experiment between Loki and Elasticsearch ran for approximately 2 hours on a single GKE cluster with minimal resource consumption. CPU usage averaged 0.15-0.25 cores throughout the test, while memory usage remained stable around 400-450 MB. The experiment cost approximately $0.04, demonstrating an extremely cost-effective benchmark for evaluating logging stack performance.",
    "metricInsights": {
      "cpu_usage": "CPU consumption remained consistently low between 0.15-0.25 cores throughout the 2-hour experiment, indicating both logging solutions were tested under light to moderate load conditions.",
      "memory_usage": "Memory working set held steady around 400-450 MB across the entire test duration, suggesting stable memory footprints for both logging backends with no memory leaks or unexpected growth patterns."
    },
    "recommendations": [
      "Extend the experiment to include actual query performance metrics (query latency, throughput) and ingestion rates to provide quantitative comparison data between Loki and Elasticsearch",
      "Add differentiated workload phases with varying log volumes (e.g., 1K, 10K, 100K logs/sec) to stress-test each solution and identify performance breakpoints",
      "Include storage growth and disk I/O metrics to compare the storage efficiency claims of Loki's chunk-based storage versus Elasticsearch's inverted indices"
