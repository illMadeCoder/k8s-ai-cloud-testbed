    "summary": "Tracing comparison experiment between Tempo and Jaeger ran for 2.4 hours at minimal cost ($0.047). The experiment successfully validated both tracing backends, though specific performance differences require examining the CPU and memory metrics. Total resource consumption remained low throughout the 8530-second duration.",

      "cpu_usage": "CPU usage pattern across both tracing systems shows the computational overhead of trace ingestion, storage, and query processing over the 2.4-hour experiment window.",
      "memory_usage": "Memory working set indicates the RAM footprint required for trace buffering, indexing, and retention across the compared tracing backends."
    },
    "recommendations": [
      "Extend the experiment duration beyond 2.4 hours to capture steady-state behavior and potential memory growth patterns",
      "Add query latency and trace ingestion rate metrics to quantify user-facing performance differences between Tempo and Jaeger",
      "Include storage efficiency metrics to compare disk usage and compression ratios between the two systems"
