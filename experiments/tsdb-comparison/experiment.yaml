  description: "TSDB comparison - Prometheus vs VictoriaMetrics vs Mimir resource efficiency and query performance"
  tags: ["comparison", "observability", "metrics"]
  publish: true
  ttlDays: 7

  study:
    hypothesis: "VictoriaMetrics will be the most resource-efficient for single-node deployments, while Mimir will offer superior horizontal scalability at the cost of higher base resource usage"
    questions:
      - "What is the CPU and memory usage per ingested metric across all three TSDBs?"
      - "How does query performance compare for common dashboard-style PromQL queries?"
      - "What are the operational trade-offs between Prometheus' pull model, VM's fork optimizations, and Mimir's microservices architecture?"
    focus:
      - "resource efficiency per metric"
      - "query performance"
      - "horizontal scalability"
      - "operational complexity"
