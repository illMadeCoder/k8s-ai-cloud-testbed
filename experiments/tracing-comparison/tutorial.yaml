# Tracing Comparison Tutorial - Tempo vs Jaeger
name: tracing-comparison
title: "Tempo vs Jaeger - Tracing Backend Comparison"
description: |
  Compare Grafana Tempo and Jaeger for distributed tracing.
  Both receive the same traces via dual-write from OTel Collector.
duration: 60
difficulty: intermediate
prerequisites:
  - otel-tutorial

modules:
  - id: architecture-comparison
    title: "Architecture Comparison"
    objectives:
      - Understand Tempo's block-oriented storage model
      - Understand Jaeger's collector-query architecture
      - Compare deployment patterns
    checkpoints:
      - name: both-backends-running
        description: "Both Tempo and Jaeger are receiving traces"
        validation:
          type: pod_ready
          selectors:
            - app.kubernetes.io/name=tempo
            - app.kubernetes.io/name=jaeger
          namespace: tracing-comparison

  - id: query-language
    title: "Query Language Comparison"
    objectives:
      - Learn TraceQL (Tempo)
      - Learn Jaeger query interface
      - Compare capabilities
    checkpoints:
      - name: query-tempo
        description: "Queried traces in Tempo using TraceQL"
        validation:
          type: manual
          instructions: |
            In Grafana Explore, select Tempo and run:
            {resource.service.name="user-service"}
      - name: query-jaeger
        description: "Queried traces in Jaeger UI"
        validation:
          type: manual
          instructions: |
            kubectl port-forward svc/jaeger-query 16686:16686 -n tracing-comparison
            Open http://localhost:16686
            Select user-service and click Find Traces

  - id: ui-comparison
    title: "UI/UX Comparison"
    objectives:
      - Compare Grafana Explore vs Jaeger UI
      - Evaluate trace visualization
      - Compare service maps
    checkpoints:
      - name: compare-trace-views
        description: "Compared the same trace in both UIs"
        validation:
          type: manual
          instructions: |
            Find the same trace ID in both:
            1. Grafana Tempo: Search by trace ID
            2. Jaeger UI: Search by trace ID

            Compare the waterfall views and information displayed.

  - id: feature-comparison
    title: "Feature Comparison"
    objectives:
      - Compare structural queries (Tempo >> operator)
      - Compare service graph visualization
      - Evaluate when to use each
    checkpoints:
      - name: structural-query
        description: "Tried a structural query in Tempo"
        validation:
          type: manual
          instructions: |
            In Tempo, try a structural query:
            {resource.service.name="user-service"} >> {resource.service.name="payment-service"}

            This finds traces where user-service eventually calls payment-service.
            Note: Jaeger doesn't have this capability.

  message: |
    You've compared Tempo and Jaeger!

    Summary:
    | Aspect | Tempo | Jaeger |
    |--------|-------|--------|
    | Query | TraceQL (powerful) | Basic filters |
    | UI | Grafana (unified) | Dedicated UI |
    | Storage | Block (efficient) | Pluggable |
    | Integration | Loki/Prometheus | Standalone |
    | Project | Grafana Labs | CNCF Graduated |

    When to use each:
    - **Tempo**: If you use Grafana stack (LGTM), want TraceQL
    - **Jaeger**: If you want dedicated tracing UI, CNCF ecosystem
