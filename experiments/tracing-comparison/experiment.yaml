  description: "Tempo vs Jaeger tracing comparison - architecture, query languages, features"
  tags: ["comparison", "observability", "tracing"]
  publish: true
  ttlDays: 7

  study:
    hypothesis: "Tempo will use fewer resources than Jaeger due to its object-storage-native architecture, while Jaeger will provide a more mature query UI and wider ecosystem integration"
    questions:
      - "What is the resource overhead of each tracing backend under equivalent trace volume?"
      - "How do TraceQL and Jaeger's query API compare for operational debugging workflows?"
      - "What are the storage architecture trade-offs (object storage vs. Elasticsearch/Cassandra)?"
    focus:
      - "resource efficiency"
      - "query capability"
      - "storage backend architecture"
      - "OTLP ingestion compatibility"
